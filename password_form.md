# Form for Saving Passwords in Firefox

<form method="get" action="#">
  <input type="text" placeholder="Username"><br>
  <input type="password" placeholder="Password"><br>
  <input type="Submit" value="Save Password">
</form>

This form is a way to save passwords in Firefox for sites that don't allow saving passwords.  
This form is built in a way such that it doesn't send the username or password anywhere, so don't worry about that.
