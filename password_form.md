    <h1>Form for Saving Passwords in Firefox</h1>
    <form method="get" action="#">
      <input type="text" placeholder="Username"><br>
      <input type="password" placeholder="Password"><br>
      <input type="Submit" value="Save Password">
    </form>
    <p>
      This form is a way to save passwords in Firefox for sites that don't allow saving passwords.<br>
      This form is built in a way such that it doesn't send the username or password anywhere, so don't worry about that.
