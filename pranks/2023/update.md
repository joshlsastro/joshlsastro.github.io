# General Update

Update: While I have not updated the [Virtual Worlds Final Project](https://github.com/joshlsastro/CS_462_Stellar_Evolution) repository for months, it will be completed by the end of summer. If you're looking for something funny for April Fools', I recommend looking into the [Lobster War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobster_War).
