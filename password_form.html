    <h1>Form for Saving Passwords in Firefox</h1>
    <form method="post" action="about:license">
      <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username">
        <br>
        <br>
      <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password">
        <br>
        <br>
      <input type="Submit" value="Save Password">
    </form>
    <p>
      This form is a way to save passwords in Firefox for sites that don't allow saving passwords.
      The password goes to a page within Firefox itself, so it's never transmitted anywhere.
