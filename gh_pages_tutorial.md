# GitHub Pages Tutorial

There are a lot of options for hosting websites. Today, I'll tell you how to use GitHub Pages. 

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create an account if you don't already have one. Note: Pick your username carefully since the name of your website will include it. 
2. Once you're logged in, make sure you're on the Desktop site. 
3. Since the website will be in a GitHub repository, I would recommend an unofficial, but great, tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY)
4. Create a new repository.
5. Name your repository *username*.github.io where *username* is your username. So if your username was joshlsastro, you would name the repository joshlsastro.github.io. 
6. Make sure you check the box saying "Initialize this repository with a README". If you don't, making the repository is (rightfully) a pain. 
7. Once you create the repository, go to Settings and under "GitHub Pages", pick a theme with the theme chooser. 
8. Go back to Code and create a file named index.md. 
9. Edit index.md. It is in a format called Markdown, which you can learn about [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
